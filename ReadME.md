Circuit Challenge by Shellmates \n
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= Task =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
Hello soldier,
It seems like ROXy and FOXy found another way to encrypt data, they are now using hardware based encryption for the sake of encrypting huge amount of data. Our secret agent has successfully sniffed out the most important file in our mission to crack their secret, the blueprint of their logic circuit! He additionnaly captured an encrypted message that we are curious to know its contents.
Now it's all up to you to reverse engineer the circuit, and provide us with a decryption of their messages.
Yours sincerely, TheMentor.
